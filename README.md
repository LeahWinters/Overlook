Overlook was assigned to me as a final solo project in my second quarter at Turing. It is a hotel application where a manager or a guest can log in. Users can search a date that they would like to stay at the hotel, filter the availablerooms by the room type, and select a room to book which pushes the booking to the data base we were given. A manager can do all of the same things a user can do, but they can also search for a guest by name in the seach input, book a room for the found guest, and delete a booking for that guest which deletes the booking for the given data base.

## Learning Goals:
  - to impliment ES6 Javascript, JQuery, and SASS

### To view this application follow the steps below!

## Clone This Repo

That's right, _clone_ not fork. You will use this repo multiple times, but you can only fork a repository once. So here is what you need to do to clone the repo and still be able to push changes to your repo:

1. Clone down this repo. Since you don't want to name your project "webpack-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
1. Remove the default remote: `git remote rm origin` (notice that `git remote -v` not gives you back nothing)
1. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of `[what you want to name the repo]` to be consistent with naming
1. Copy the address that you would use to clone down this repo - something like `git@github.com:...`
1. Add this remote to your cloned down repo: `git remote add origin [address you copied in the previous step]` - do not include the brackets

Now try to commit something and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.

## Setup

After one person has gone through the steps of cloning down this repo and editing the remote, everyone should clone down the repo. 

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

npm install

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.
